He has a lot of experience on how to create code that follows the best practices, yet is simple to understand, adapt and extend! That's the best way to create code IMO! Besides that, he loves to share what he knows and he's really good on teaching/mentoring everything related to coding to all types of developers, from totally newbies to veterans in code! Not to mention that he's a fantastic person, friendly, cheerful and always supportive!"
