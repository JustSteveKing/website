description: Explore the shift to a new personal blog for a broader range of technical topics and insights this year.
---

So I have decided that I will be concentrating my blogging time to a personal
blog instead of my company blog this year, for several reasons. My company
blog is specific to what I do as a company; less broad articles about services
and topics we cover as a company. While this is ok, and it works, it leaves me
quite constrained in what I can write about.

So this blog is about all the things I wish to write about, mostly technical, and gives me a channel to get some thoughts out of my head and onto a markdown file that I can revisit later on.
